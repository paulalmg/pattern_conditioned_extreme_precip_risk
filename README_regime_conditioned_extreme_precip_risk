Methodology description

This code presents a methodology to derive extreme precipitation probability forecasts over
South East Asia conditioned by the occurrence of two sets of weather regimes: a two-tiered 
assignment, that first considers large-scale patterns and then assigns synoptic-scale 
regimes, and a 'flat' classification, which only considers the synoptic scale. In the 
'tiered' approach, the tier 1 large-scale regimes, which capture ENSO and seasonal 
variations, are each partitioned into South East Asia regional clusters that capture 
synoptic variability. 

The method here considers an ensemble forecast of 850hPa wind field, computes the 
probabilities of being in all the regimes and simultaneously considers the ERA5-derived 
statistical link between the occurrence of a given regime and the probabilities of extreme 
precipitation. By convoluting these sets of probabilities, the method produces a forecast for 
the risk of precipitation exceedance conditioned by the weather regimes. 


Software structure and components

The code is contained in the file 'script_regime_conditioned_extreme_precip_risk.py' which 
reads a given ensemble forecast for u,v @ 850 hPa and the corresponding forecast valid date 
and lead time, and then makes use of the following modules:

1) assign_flat_tiered_regime_probabilities(u_fcst,v_fcst)

Computes the forecasted probabilities of being in each regime, for both the flat and 
tiered sets. A sample script that allows to download UKMO GloSea5 s2s forecast data is included 
within the 'additional_scripts' sub-directory.

2) reg_cond_exceed_probs(prob_reg_flat,prob_reg_tiered, exceedance_args)

considers:
   - the ERA5-GPM derived probabilities of precipitation exceedance given each regime
   - the above calculate forecast probabilities 
   - an exceedance criteria (threshold or percentile, with a limited set of options)
and calculates the forecasted probabilities of precipitation exceedance for that criteria 
and for both the flat and tiered regimes. See note below for criteria options.

3) clim_exceed_probs(date, exceedance_args)

considers:
   - the ERA5-GPM derived probabilities of precipitation exceedance given each regime
   - the climatological probabilities of being in the regimes given the day of the year 
   - an exceedance criteria (threshold or percentile, with a limited set of options)
and calculates the forecasted probabilities of precipitation exceedance for that criteria
and for both the flat and tiered regimes. See note below for criteria options.

4) test_gpm_exceed(date, obs_precip_file,exceedance_args)

If the forecast valid date is within the GPM coverage, this module allows the user to calculate the 
observed areas of precipitation exceedance.

5) plot_fcst_and_clim_exceed_prob(datet,lead,latitudes,longitudes,cond_pr_flat,cond_pr_tiered,cond_pr_flat_clim,cond_pr_tiered_clim, exceedance_args)

This module allows the user to plot jointly the obtained forecasted flat and tiered regime-conditioned
 probabilities of exceedance together with the corresponding climatological probabilities.

6) plot_obs_precip_and_exceed(datet,latitudes,longitudes,obs_pr,obs_exceed, exceedance_args)

This module allows the user to plot the observed exceedance regions together with the daily 
precipitation field. A sample script to obtain a daily precipitation field from the NASA GPM 
dataset is included within the 'additional_scripts' sub-directory.
 
7) plot_relevant_regimes

This module plots the forecasted flat and tiered regimes centroids and their contributions 
towards extreme precipitation risk, indicating the forecasted probability of occurrence of each
regime. Only the relevant regimes are plotted, ranging between 1 and the number of forecast 
ensemble members. 


#******************
Exceedance criteria
#******************


The examples set up in this package allow to choose the following exceedance criteria options:

'kind': either 'threshold' or 'percentile'
'threshold': currently 25 is only allowed (meaning 25mm/day)
'percentile': currently 75 and 90 are only allowed (meaningh 75th and 90th percentiles)
'seas': indicates whether or not a seasonally-varying climatology should be considered. Currently, 
	seas should always be set to True for kind 'percentile' and False for kind 'threshold'.
'window': length in days of the seasonal window considered, currently only 60 is allowed.
'res': resolution at which the GPM exceedance is considered. Currently, only the S2S-based '1p5degree' 
	resolution is allowed.

For the design of any other exceedance cases, additional python scripts are provided, based on
obtaining the full GPM climatology from this dataset: https://gpm.nasa.gov/data/directory. These scripts, 
included in the 'additional_scripts' sub-directory, can also be adapted to any other daily precipitation 
climatological set and are titled:
 
  script_calculate_precip_climatologies.py
  script_calculate_regime_conditioned_precip_statistics.py 

Running instructions are provided within. an input to these scripts are the climatological occurrences of 
the 'flat' and 'tiered' rgeimes in ERA5, which are included as text .csv files in the 'input_data' 
sub-directory. Users might find these of interest for different applications as well.
